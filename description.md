## **About**

This program serves as an enhancement to better a user's experience while using Github.

This is program makes GitHub easier by allowing users to take any files they want and edit them without having to use or make another repository or separate branches from the master. This also saves storage on a user's computer.

## **How It Works**

When you run the program, you will see a simple GUI. Using your GitHub username and personal access token, you are able to login to the program. After logging in, you are able to select any of your repositories, a branch in that repository, and a file from that branch that you wish to edit. Once you select your desired file, the file will open in a new window and you will be able to make your changes right there. These changes will be saved and updated immediately in the repository.
